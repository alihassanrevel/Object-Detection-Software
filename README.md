# Object-Detection-Software

This repository is for educational purpose only. If some of the code doesn't work for you can conctact me and refer to the 
name of repository I will try to help you

Here in this repository I showed you how to use yolov4-tiny model to do object detection and how we can make our executable software

The build directory contains the exe dir, Just copy it and paste it to any system and run main.py file, and, you will see
now our program runs on all computers without the need of any installations

And in order to use this code to try that for yourself, you need to have python 3.7 or less than 3.7, don't use latest python version because some of the packages doesn't work properly with it and lastly just install the packages mentioned in requirements.txt.

All the credit goes to my sensei pysource.
